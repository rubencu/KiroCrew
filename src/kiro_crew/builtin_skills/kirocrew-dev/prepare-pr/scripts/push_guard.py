"""push_guard.py - pre-push stale-base guard for the prepare-pr skill.

Verifies that the current HEAD is safe to force-push by checking:
1. The fetch of origin/<base> succeeds (fail closed on network error).
2. origin/<base> is an ancestor of HEAD (i.e. HEAD sits on the freshly
   fetched base tip, not on a stale fork point that would cause the squash
   to bake in reversions of newer base changes).
3. The number of commits HEAD is ahead of origin/<base> is plausibly small
   (default threshold: 5 commits for a single-commit PR workflow; configurable
   via --max-ahead).
4. None of the ahead-commits are patch-equivalent to commits in a bounded
   window (REPLAY_HISTORY_WINDOW) of origin/<base> history.  Comparison uses
   `git patch-id --stable` so renames, whitespace, and commit metadata are
   ignored — only the semantic diff matters.  The window is bounded because
   full history is unbounded cost, and replayed commits from a recent stale
   fork are by construction recent.

This prevents the catastrophic failure mode where a worktree branched from a
local integration trunk (kiki-trunk) carries 100+ unshipped commits that get
force-pushed to the remote feature branch, clobbering upstream work.

Portable: stdlib only; shells out to git via argument lists.

# Pattern that matches everything after the authority (host[:port]) in a

# Rationale: the fetch target is always `origin`, so the path carries no
# diagnostic value the operator does not already have, while it CAN carry
# path-embedded tokens (some forges/proxies put PATs in the URL path).
# Redacting the entire post-authority portion in one pass closes userinfo,
# path-token, query-string-token, and fragment-token credential shapes
# simultaneously, preventing the layered-redaction rounds that seeded
# repeated findings.  The host[:port] is preserved for diagnostic value.
# Captures: group 1 = scheme://host[:port], remainder begins at /, ?, or #.
#
# Authority forms covered (RFC 3986 § 3.2):
#   - reg-name / IPv4:   host chars excluding delimiters (: / ? # and ws)
#   - Bracketed IPv6:    [<anything>] — covers hex:colon addresses, zone-ids
#     (%25eth0), and IPvFuture forms without an itemized charset.
# The remainder trigger is [/?#] (not just /) so query-only URLs
# (https://host?token=x) and fragment-only URLs are also redacted.

    """Strip URL credentials from diagnostic text to prevent leaks.

    Two passes:
    1. Userinfo: replaces ``://user:token@`` or ``://user@`` with
       ``://<redacted>@`` so the host remains visible.
    2. Post-authority: replaces everything after the host[:port] (path, query
       string, and fragment) with ``/<redacted>``.  This subsumes path-embedded
       tokens, query-string credentials (private_token=, access_token=, etc.),
       and fragment credentials in a single pass.

    The authority pattern covers reg-name/IPv4 hosts AND bracketed IPv6
    authorities (``[::1]``, ``[2001:db8::7]``, with optional zone-id).
    The remainder trigger is ``/``, ``?``, or ``#`` — so query-only URLs
    (``https://host?private_token=x``) are also redacted.

    After both passes, the output for any scheme-bearing URL is at most
    ``scheme://host[:port]/<redacted>`` (or ``scheme://<redacted>@host[:port]/<redacted>``
    if userinfo was present).  The host is preserved for diagnostic value;
    the path is NOT because the fetch target is always ``origin`` and the
    operator already knows the path.
