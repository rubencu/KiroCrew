        big its body is, and how many times that body was actually DELIVERED into
        a prompt. Cost is the product of the last two, and a user deciding
        whether to opt a skill out cannot weigh it without both.

        ``deliveries`` counts body deliveries, not trigger matches: the ledger
        records only when a body reaches the prompt, so a false-positive match, a
        pointer-only skill, and an undelivered match all count zero. Two
        consequences a caller must not paper over — a skill already opted out
        stops accruing entirely, so its figure is historical and frozen; and this
        is therefore a measure of what was SPENT, never of how often the skill
        was relevant.

        ``deliveries`` is ``None`` when the skill has no ledger entry, which is
        different from zero: an entry can also age out of the 30-day window.

        ``owned`` says whether Kiro Crew may rewrite the file. A skill reached
        through ``skills.extra_paths`` is listed but not ours to edit, so the UI
        must not offer a toggle the endpoint will refuse.

        This runs on the event loop as part of context assembly (the skill
        index). Unconfined rows take exactly one stat and reuse its mtime for

        Split out so the rollback has one exit rather than being threaded through
        ``create_skill``'s branches. A partial create is not merely untidy here: the
        leftover directory makes ``create_skill``'s ``exists()`` guard answer False
        forever, so every retry is a 409 over a truncated body that ``list_skills()``
        still serves. Steering's create already unlinks its partial leaf for exactly
        that reason; this is the same rule, plus the directory, because this call is
        the one that created it.

        The leaf directory is created and opened RELATIVE to *parent_fd*, not through
        ``pinned_fs.create_and_open_dir_pinned``. That helper resolves
        ``skill_dir.parent`` with its own ``realpath`` and pins it again, discarding
        the descriptor the caller already walked -- a second resolution, which an
        ancestor swapped since the first is followed by. It would also leave the
        create and the rollback addressing two different directories, so on such a
        swap ``SKILL.md`` lands outside the skills root while the rollback reports an
        identity mismatch on an unrelated one. The helper's two other jobs are
        reproduced here rather than borrowed: a name that already exists is refused
        because ``os.mkdir`` under the pinned parent raises ``FileExistsError`` (the
        exclusivity is the syscall's, not a flag on a helper), and a link or
        non-directory at the leaf becomes the one refusal the caller maps rather than
        a raw errno.

        A skill carrying ``repo_scope: <relpath>`` is only eligible for

        — e.g. ``repo_scope: src/kiro_crew`` restricts a skill to sessions

        loader-enforced counterpart to a prose "ignore this skill elsewhere"
        scope guard: prose depends on probabilistic LLM obedience, while this
        check runs before the skill ever reaches the context (destructive
        repo-dev instructions must be mechanically contained).

        *project_dir* is the SESSION's active project — the same value the

        started from inside a checkout of the scoped repo admitted the skill

        suppressed it for every session, contributors included.

        Fails CLOSED — no project, an unusable one, or any error suppresses the
        skill, so an un-scoped surface never inherits repo-specific rules.

        The rule itself lives in ``kiro_crew.project_scope`` because lessons are

        tool, the ``$skillname`` inline token, ``cat``, and the per-message
        trigger auto-loader. This bounds the unconfined summary block so no
        single section can blow the context budget.

        on the legacy path. Production callers pass the skills section cap so a
        checkout cannot materialize many large bodies before their final context
        is truncated. When omitted, an integer *budget* supplies the same bound.

        *only* restricts the block to skills whose ``SKILL.md`` path matches one
        of the given fnmatch globs — the agent template's ``skill://`` mapping
        (see ``agent_discovery.agent_skill_globs``). ``None`` (the default) means
        no restriction. An *only* list that matches nothing yields ``""`` rather
